ObjectPath
----------

This gem defines the ObjectPath::Mixin to be included in any
ruby class where the path/url of an ActiveRecord model is
useful.

The path/url generated by the ObjectPath::Mixin will be the
same as generated by Rails according to the routes defined
in your Rails application.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'object_path'
----

And then execute:

....
$ bundle
....

Or install it yourself as:

....
$ gem install object_path
....

Usage
~~~~~

----
class Notification
  include ObjectPath::Mixin
end

n = Notification.new

n.object_path(@blog_post)                         # => '/blog_posts/:id'
n.object_path(@blog_post, :edit)                  # => '/blog_posts/:id/edit'
n.object_path(@blog_post, :edit, context: 'next') # => '/blog_posts/:id/edit?context=next'
n.object_path(BlogPost.new)                       # => '/blog_posts/new'
----

Include ObjectPath::Mixin in the class you want. The path of the
model/collection and action will be generated according to the routes
defined in your Rails application by calling the object_path method.
You can also call the object_url method with exactly the same arguments
if you want to get the url of the model/collection instead.

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run
`bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version
number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which
will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and
push the `.gem` file to https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
